# About
This document is intended to serve as an addendum to the existing Wownero white
paper (wownero.org/whitepaper.pdf) and attempts to provide a brief synopsis of the
core technologies Wownero (and Monero) utilize. A brief history of Wownero and a brief
synopsis of core technologies will be provided. The Wownero blockchain, Proof-of-Work
algorithm, and privacy enhancing features will be summarized in respective sections.

# Contributing
Because this was written as what was susposed to be a 2-3 page paper for a college assignment 
I was forced to omit many details and entire sections which would have been good to imclude.

The document is written in LaTeX and can be compiled with
