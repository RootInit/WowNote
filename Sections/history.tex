\section{Wownero History}
Wonero is a Monero software fork created by John Winter Murphy (``jwinterm'')\cite{wowdere_dev} in response to, and with the goal of beating, ``MoneroV''\cite{jwinterview}. Wownero started as a casual discussion between John Murphy and his friend, Carty Sewill, about a hypothetical meme coin with some of the same features as MoneroV but as a fully legitimate and functional non-scam coin\cite{jwinterview}.

MoneroV, announced February 2018, was another fork of Monero with the main defining feature of having finite supply and no tail emission\cite{monerov}. In addition to the software, MoneroV also forked the Monero blockchain giving all existing Monero users 10 ``XMV'' for each ``XMR''\footnote{\textbf{XMR} is the common shorthand used for Monero similar to Wownero's abbreviation of ``WOW''.} they held.
Because MoneroV presold coins to investors, claimed a large percentage of coins as a ``dev tax,'' it is widely believed to have been entirely a scam\cite{monerov_scam,monerov}. 


Wownero was successfully launched on April 1st 2018 achieving their goal of launching ahead of MoneroV\cite{jwinterview}. Carty Sewill designed the original logo (Figure \ref{fig:logos}) and artwork used for the project\cite{jwinterview}. Like MoneroV, Wownero featured a limited max supply of approximately 10x the amount of Monero coins, but without any scammy pre-mined coins or ICO\footnote{\textbf{ICO} or Initial Coin Offering refers to a presale of a token offered to investors before launch} and utilized its own unique Genesis block\footnote{A \textbf{genesis block} is the initial block in the blockchain.} making it an entirely separate cryptocurrency from Monero.

Wownero was described by jwinterm in a personal communication as ``to Monero what Dogecoin is to Bitcoin'' (2023 \cite{jwinterview}). True to this claim, Wownero, has predominantly been used by a largely meme based community and, like Dogecoin, Wownero is categorized by many as a ``shitcoin'' though some may (sarcastically) disagree as shown in \texttt{Figure \ref{fig:theshitmeme}}.

A strong and active community has formed around Wownero and developed a full software ecosystem to make Wownero a more functional and user-friendly coin. Community projects include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item GUI, TUI, and VR wallets\cite{wowlet}.
    \item Blockchain explorers\cite{muchwowblocks}.
    \item Informational websites\cite{wowbsite,slimecash}.
    \item Promotional memes, artwork, and stickers\cite{suchwow}.
    \item A Discord server, subreddit, and dedicated forum\cite{wowrum}.
    \item A privately hosted Git server for software development collaboration\cite{wowrepo}.
\end{itemize}

Monero and Wownero have always had trouble getting listed on most major exchanges as such exchanges generally avoid privacy coins both for fear of future regulatory legislation, and because centralized exchanges (which require ID verification) are not likely to be popular with the privacy coin demographic. Wownero has been primarily traded through ``TradeOgre'' and has reciently been listed on various exchanges including ``MajesticBank,'' ``LocalMonero,'' and ``Agoradesk'' \cite{jwinterview}. The Wownero community is optimistic regarding near future listings on other exchanges.
