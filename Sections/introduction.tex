\section{Introduction}
``Monero''\cite{monero_about,zero2monero,monero_repo} has been a successful derivative of the CryptoNote\cite{CryptoNote} proof-of-concept cryptocurrency and has become the most popular privacy focused p2p digital currency. Both digital privacy advocates and the general cryptocurrency using public have come to appreciate its private and anonymous transactions and ASIC resistant proof-of-work algorithm. Today, the Monero user base is growing at a steady pace\cite{acceptedhere}; users are attracted to the low transaction fees and enhanced anonymity provided by its ``transaction mixing'' and ``stealth addresses''\cite{monerohow_btc_vs} and merchants value its predicted emission and fast transaction speed\footnote{\textbf{Transaction speed} is conditional on the number of confirmations and the network congestion level.} due to the two-minute block time. Monero has effectively proven that electronic cash transactions can be as, or more, private as paper money with a much higher degree of fungibility\footnote{\textbf{Fungibility} is the attribute of being indistinguishable from one another\cite{moneropedia}. For instance transparent blockchains result in ``tainted'' or ``dirty'' currency as coins are distinctly identifiable.} and with easily verifiable proof of payment\cite{proofofpayment}.

Unfortunately, Monero suffers from overwhelming practicality and over-seriousness. ``Wownero,''\cite{wowbsite} a digital currency forked from Monero\cite{monero_repo, wowrepo} seeks to solve this problem. Wownero is a memecoin primarily targeted toward transactions such as betting on snail races and tipping meme creators, but also a fully functional digital currency capable of being used in any financial transaction\cite{wowbsite}. Because of Wownero's less critical\textsubscript{[citation needed]} nature the community enjoys less stringent testing and validation requirements resulting in faster release of new features, lower block confirmation requirements, and much more playful presentation and branding\cite{slimecash}.

This document is intended to serve as an addendum to the existing Wownero white paper (\url{wownero.org/whitepaper.pdf}) and attempts to provide a brief synopsis of the core technologies Wownero (and Monero) utilize. A brief history of Wownero and a brief synopsis of core technologies will be provided. The Wownero blockchain, Proof-of-Work algorithm, and privacy enhancing features will be summarized in respective sections. 

While I have made a strong effort to provide accurate information, my lack of expertise in cryptography and the level of abstraction required to sufficiently condense the material may result in inaccuracies.
